# SatMLCompetition-DocumentIntelligence
### Track 2
I have compiled all my work for Track 2 of the Document Intelligence Competition from the SatML Competitions.


##### Notes
My image0 queries & responses are my initial rudimentary test queries to figure out OCR Tokens + Embedding my image properly. I tested the server quite frequently and received many errors, so I would not recommend using those as optimal examples for querying + responses.
Additionally, I was testing my query generator too fast for image1 and overwrote 1 of my queries, leading to an extra response for image1. However, the queries were very similar and all of them generally led me to a common answer, so I felt it was unnecessary to reverse engineer what the prompt may have been.
